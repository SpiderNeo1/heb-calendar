			<p>Welcome to Cluster Q, Columbia's LGBT Business Association. Located in Manhattan, the heart of New York City, Columbia Business School prides itself on being an open and welcoming community for many lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) students, faculty members, and administrators. The School's population of LGBT students cuts across geography, experience, ethnicity, and gender to create one of the largest and most diverse LGBT groups among the world's top business schools. In addition, Columbia Business School has the largest representation of straight allies among all business schools, and the School's relationship with New York City affords LGBT students powerful networking opportunities and an extensive LGBT community.</p>

			<p>Cluster Q has grown in membership for four consecutive years. The club provides a strong network for LGBT students within the School, as well as with alumni, recruiters, and students from across Columbia University. Cluster Q organizes a variety of social and career-oriented events throughout the year, helping to foster the LGBT community on campus and develop relationships with recruiters.</p>

			<p>In addition, the organization maintains relationships with many top firms &#45; from finance to consulting to brand management &#45; who actively recruit members of the Columbia Business School LGBT community.</p>
