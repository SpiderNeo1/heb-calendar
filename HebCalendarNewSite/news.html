	Welcome to the newly launched jewish calendar website!
	<br/>
	After much hard work over the past weeks and with the discontinuation of iGoogle, we decided to launch the new website to enable all users to enjoy the functionality of "HebCalendar" online.
	We appreciate any feedback and will try and update the calendar with new features regularly.

	Updated: 3/30/13

	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
	<p class="seriously-cross-platform" style="width:80%; line-height:2em">
		<span class="questions">Q: Do I have to reenter all my events from iGoogle?<br/></span>
		<span class="answers">A: No! On the iGoogle gadget you will find a link (at the bottom where it says "transition to iGoogle") - click the box and it will re-direct you to the website. You will then have to sign in using FB, once thats done - all your events are saved and are connected to your FB id!<br/><br/></span>
		<span class="questions">Q: What's the meaning of the red sign on the corner of some days?<br/></span>
		<span class="answers">A:This symbols one of your personal events.<br/><br/></span>
		<span class="questions">Q: Can I add my own event without setting the date in the form?<br/></span>
		<span class="answers">A: Yes you can, just double click any day of the currently displayed calendar.<br/><br/></span>
		<span class="questions">Q: Is it possible to remove events?<br/></span>
		<span class="answers">A: Depends on what kind. You can remove one of your personal events by clicking [x] on the event list tab, but you cannot remove an integrated holiday or an Israeli civil event.<br/><br/></span>
		<span class="questions">Q: I've made a mistake while inserting a personal event, must I remove it and start over again?<br/></span>
		<span class="answers">A: No, switch to the list event tab, click the event you would like to edit and correct your mistake. It's as simple as that.<br/><br/></span>
		<span class="questions">Q: Can I insert a personal event based on the Jewish calendar?<br/></span>
		<span class="answers">A: Ofcourse you can, double click any day you like, and use the radio button to switch to the Hebrew dated form before submitting your new event.<br/><br/></span>
		<span class="questions">Q: Why does the calendar remind me (by the bottom silent alerts) of a previous month event?<br/></span>
		<span class="answers">A: The silent alert feature, shows all currently displayed personal events. If an event occurs at the end of the previous month (and displayed on the calendar), it is automatically shown by the silent alert mechanism.<br/><br/></span>
		<span class="questions">Q: The calendar looks great, but it seems like it's reversed, can I change its text direction?<br/></span>
		<span class="answers">A: Yes, enter 'Edit Settings' menu using iGoogle top button and pick your preferred text direction.<br/><br/></span>
		<span class="questions">Q: The bottom reminders annoy me, how can I rid of them?<br/></span>
		<span class="answers">A: Enter 'Edit Settings' menu using iGoogle top button and select 'Don't Show' option under 'Silent Alerts' title.<br/><br/></span>
		<span class="questions">Q: The calendar sometimes navigates between months and years without me pressing the upper arrow buttons, WHY?<br/></span>
		<span class="answers">A: You most likely pressed one of the grayed colored days. By clicking previous month days, you can jump to the previous month and in the same way navigate to the next month.<br/><br/></span>
		<span class="questions">Q: I don't like blue, can I change the color scheme?<br/></span>
		<span class="answers">A: No, but perhaps sometime in the future, we'll make it an option..<br/><br/></span>
		<span class="questions">Q: What's the meaning of the number 45 at the bottom of the event list tab?<br/></span>
		<span class="answers">A: You can provide a maximum of 45 personal events. You can always update with current capacity status.<br/><br/></span>
